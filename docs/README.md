# CoinControl

## About

CoinControl is a mobile money management application designed to track spendings and income statistics while also providing insightful analytics to users. The mobile app is fitted with an account system and cloud storage/backups. Record analytics are also available for users to very spending and income trends and other data. The app also has a built-in calculator as the input number pad for easy on-the-stop calculations and recordings of expenses and incomes.

## Future Plans

Some next steps I have in mind are creating a web application for CoinControl, so data can be accessed and updated on the computer as well, which will improve accessibility and ease of use.
